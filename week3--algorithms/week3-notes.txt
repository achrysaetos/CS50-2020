Types of Searches and Big O
---------------------------
Common running times (in order of best to worst case): O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n^2)
You figure out the running time by looking at the dominant term.

Linear search -- O(n)           start from the first item, end at the last item.
Binary search -- O(log n)       half, determine whether to go left or right, half, determine again, etc.
Bubble sort -- O(n^2)           look at the first two items and switch if necc, look at the second two items and switch if necc, 
                                all the way to the end... then repeat n-1 times.
Selection sort -- O(n^2)        go through the whole list and remember the smallest item, swap with the first list item,
                                repeat with the rest of the list.
Merge sort -- O(n log n)        sort left half of item, sort right half of items, merge.

Other Types of Gauges
---------------------
Omega notation -- indicates best time
Theta notation -- describes running time if the upper and lower bounds are the same
