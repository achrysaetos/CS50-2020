Things to Note for Python
-------------------------
Python doesn't need to import a standard library, declare a main function, specify a new line, or use semicolons.
Python is an interpreted language, which means we can run "python ___.py" without having to compile our program.
Python doesn't use curly braces; nesting is instead determined by exact indentation of each line of code.

Python doesn't have chars. So we use strings instead.
Python strings are like C structs. We can use the dot operator with them.

**Know Python's special syntaxes and availabilities. (ie. for loops, conditionals, printing, etc.)**
