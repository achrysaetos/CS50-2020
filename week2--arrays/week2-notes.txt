Tools We Can Use
----------------
We can flag a line of code by putting a red dot next to the line number, and the debugger will know where to look.
bool -- 1 byte, char -- 1 byte, int -- 4 bytes, float -- 4 bytes, long -- 8 bytes, double -- 8 bytes
Arrays and strings both have lengths for you to iterate through.
