To Compile a C File
-------------------
type "clang week1.c" to start compilation. see now that there is a new file called "a.out".
run "a.out" by typing "./a.out" into the terminal.

alternatively, type "clang -o week1 week1.c" to tell clang to save the compiled output as week1
then just run ./week1

To Import a Library
-------------------
you also have to tell your compiler to add the special library file with something like 
    "clang -o string week1-1.c -lcs50" where -l means link.
